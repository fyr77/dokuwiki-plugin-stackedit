StackEdit Plugin for DokuWiki

Markdown editor with live preview

This plugin is a simple implementation of StackEdit.js by Benoit Schweblin (https://github.com/benweet/stackedit.js). 
It adds a button to the dokuwiki toolbar to open StackEdit. It is best used in combination with a Markdown plugin like Markdowku (https://www.dokuwiki.org/plugin:markdowku).

All documentation for this plugin can be found at
https://github.com/fyr77/dokuwiki-plugin-stackedit

If you install this plugin manually, make sure it is installed in
lib/plugins/stackedit/ - if the folder is called different it
will not work!
