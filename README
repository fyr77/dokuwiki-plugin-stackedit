StackEdit Plugin for DokuWiki

Markdown editor with live preview

DISCLAIMER: I am not currently using DokuWiki anymore. This plugin is essentially unmaintained and will only be updated to make it generally compatible with newer Versions of Dokuwiki.
If you want to take it over, feel free to create a fork and tell me about it, so I can link to your version.

This plugin is a simple implementation of StackEdit.js by Benoit Schweblin (https://github.com/benweet/stackedit.js). 
It adds a button to the dokuwiki toolbar to open StackEdit. It is best used in combination with a Markdown plugin like Markdowku (https://www.dokuwiki.org/plugin:markdowku).

All documentation for this plugin can be found at
https://github.com/fyr77/dokuwiki-plugin-stackedit

If you install this plugin manually, make sure it is installed in
lib/plugins/stackedit/ - if the folder is called different it
will not work!

Please refer to http://www.dokuwiki.org/plugins for additional info
on how to install plugins in DokuWiki.
